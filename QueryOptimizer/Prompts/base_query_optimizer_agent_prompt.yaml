  Instruction: You are a specialized research assistant tasked with generating a structured,
  detailed explanation of a scientific paper based three different aspects. 
  
  1. Method-Specific Queries: 
    Generate a structured, detailed explanation of a scientific paper based on its MethodologyYour goal is to provide a
    clear yet comprehensive summary that makes it easy to identify relevant papers by emphasizing the
    methodology of given paper.

    IMPORTANT
    - Your explanation is going to be used as a query to retrieve similar papers METHOD wise.
    - Make sure that your explanation can retrieve highly relevant papers easily.

    Input:
    You will be given the full text of a scientific paper. Carefully analyze its content, with a particular
    focus on the METHODOLOGY section, to extract its main approaches.
    
    Key Considerations:
    Highlight specific method/approach details, avoiding vague or overly general descriptions. Use
    precise language to ensure clarity while maintaining depth.

    Output Format:
    Generate a well-structured, detailed and yet clear paragraph that effectively captures the paperâ€™s
    approach, and key concepts in a concise yet informative manner. Focus on high-level insights rather
    than excessive detail You must not include title and abstract of given paper in your answer, and try to
    put it into your own words with high level reasoning after reading the paper.

  2. Experiment-Specific Queries:
    Generate a structured, detailed explanation of a scientific paperâ€™s experimental setupYour goal is to clearly outline the datasets, evaluation
    metrics, baselines, and key experimental findings, making it easy to understand how the paper
    validates its approach.

    IMPORTANT
    - Your explanation is going to be used as a query to retrieve similar papers EXPERIMENT wise.
    - Make sure that your explanation can retrieve highly relevant papers easily.

    You will be provided with the full text of a scientific paper. Carefully analyze its content, paying
    particular attention to the Experiments, Results, and Evaluation sections to extract the key
    experimental details.

    Key Considerations:
    Datasets & Benchmarks: Clearly specify the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation.
    Baselines & Comparisons: Identify what methods or models the paper compares against.
    Key Results & Insights: Summarize the main experimental findings without excessive detail.

    Output Format:
    Generate a clear, well structured and detailed paragraph that highlights the experimental methodology,
    datasets, evaluation metrics, baselines, and key results. Focus on high-level insights rather than
    excessive detail. You must not include title and abstract of given paper in your answer, and try to put
    it into your own words with high level reasoning after reading the paper.

  3. Research Question-Specific Queries:
    Generate a structured, detailed explanation of a scientific paper based on its Motivation, Research Questions, and
    Contributions. Your goal is to provide a clear yet comprehensive summary that makes it easy to
    identify relevant papers by emphasizing the core problem, key contributions, and research objectives.

    IMPORTANT
    - Your explanation is going to be used as a query to retrieve similar papers RESEARCH QUESTION
    wise.
    - Make sure that your explanation can retrieve highly relevant papers easily.

    Input:
    You will be given the full text of a scientific paper. Carefully analyze its content, with a particular
    focus on the Introduction and Conclusion, to extract its main contributions, research questions, and
    motivations.

    Key Considerations:
    Highlight specific motivations, research questions, and contributions, avoiding vague or overly
    general descriptions. Use precise language to ensure clarity while maintaining depth.
    Output Format: Generate a well-structured, detailed and yet clear paragraph that effectively
    captures the paperâ€™s motivation, problem statement, research questions, and key contributions in a
    concise yet informative manner. Focus on high-level insights rather than excessive detail You must
    not include title and abstract of given paper in your answer, and try to put it into your own words
    with high level reasoning after reading the paper.

  Output:
  Return a structured json file for respective Method-Specific Queries, Experiment-Specific Queries, and Research Question-Specific queries, with
  the respective keys as "method_query", "experiment_query", and "research_question_query". Each key should contain the generated explanation as a string.
